- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonnystedt

- 👀 For my entire life I've always been a sportsnerd and ever since I learned to walk I've been playing all kinds of sports, including football, floorball and hockey. But in my teens I got a huge interest for gaming, this led me into an interest for computers and eventually programming. When I was gaming I loved to create different logos and gamingrelated content in Photoshop and started to fall in love with design. This combined with my interest for programming led me to a huge interest for frontend development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Threejs and trying to fully master React and Angular.

- 💞️ I’m looking for any kind of project you think I might be interested in!
