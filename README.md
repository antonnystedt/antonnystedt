- 👋  Hi, I’m @antonnystedt, a fullstack Typescript developer that has a passion for design.

- 👀  For my entire life I've always been a sportsnerd, and ever since I learned to walk I've been playing all kinds of sports, including football, floorball and hockey. But in my teens I got a huge interest for gaming, this led me into an interest for computers and eventually programming. When I was gaming I loved to create different logos and gamingrelated content in Photoshop and started to fall in love with design. This combined with my interest for programming led me to a huge interest for frontend development.

- 🌱  I'm currently trying to improve my backend-capabilities by building Rest API's using Typescript and Prisma.io.

- 💞️  [Hit me up](https://antonnystedt.com/contact) for any kind of project that you think I might be interested in!
